DAILY TASK LOG


Requirements
1. Record activity throughout the day by running the program and making
persistent entries which consist of the unit, start time and an optional
note.

2. Provide a reporting mechanism which displays "clock charts". Reporting
should allow a range of dates to be chosen for which a clock chart will be
shown for each day and optionally display a pie-chart displaying the 
percentage of time spent on each unit overall.

3. Units should be colour coded.
